## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 My current areas of expertise are Symfony backend development, React frontend development, and other NodeJS applications running on CloudRun.
  
- 🔭 I also have some side projects involving applications in the medical field, such as a statistical analysis application for antibiotic resistance and several data collection applications for medical use. In these cases, I use various tools, including my usual ones, but I prefer VueJS to React.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to improve my proficiency with AI agents: mainly Claude Code, but also Cursor and Copilot

- 👯 I enjoy contributing to the open-source community whenever the need or desire arises.
